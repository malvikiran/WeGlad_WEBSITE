    This is a little wired way to add a Stripe Account to the hotel, but it works. Call this page and here will appear the form to compile. When all the process will be done there will appear a cookie called "isDone" setted "true".
    The best way to do this on web probably is with another window and a listener attached to his cookies

    - name : token
